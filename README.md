# apod-ahk
Sets your Windows Desktop to the day's Astronomy Picture of the Day (apod) using AutoHotKey (ahk)!

To get it to work, you need to have (AutoHotKey)[https://www.autohotkey.com/]. I made this with v1.1.33.09 of AHK, so you mileage may vary but it should work, even with v2?????

You also need to open up the .ahk file and set the filepath to soemthing that exits on your machine.
