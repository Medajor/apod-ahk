# apod-ahk
Sets your Windows Desktop to the day's Astronomy Picture of the Day (apod) using AutoHotKey (ahk)!

To get it to work, you need to have [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). I made this with v1.1.33.09 of AHK, so you mileage may vary but it should work, even with v2?????

You also need to open up the .ahk file and set the filepath (line 10) to something that exits on your machine. 
Also, please generate your own api key [here](https://api.nasa.gov/) and change the link on line 11 to your own key. I shouldn't ever run over 1k requests/hr but who knows.
